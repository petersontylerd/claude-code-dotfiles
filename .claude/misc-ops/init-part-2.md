1. Read `MASTER_CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in full.
2. Compare the contents of the two files for **logical coherence** (no contradictory instructions, roles, or behaviors) and **referential integrity** (all references, links, and cross-references remain valid and non-conflicting).
3. If any inconsistency or conflict is found, **stop immediately**, describe the issue clearly to the user (including where in each file it appears), and ask the user for clarification or resolution **before making any changes**.
4. Once the user has clarified any issues (or if none were found), copy the entire contents of `MASTER_CLAUDE.md` (including the `# MASTER_CLAUDE.md` heading).
5. Open `CLAUDE.md` and insert that copied content at the very top of the file so the existing contents move down unchanged.
6. Save `CLAUDE.md` with the `MASTER_CLAUDE.md` text prepended.
